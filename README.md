# Cafe-API-Management-System
Developed a RESTful API to manage cafe data with full CRUD functionality. Implemented secure API key authorization for delete operations and supported fetching random or all cafes in JSON. Used SQLAlchemy ORM for database management, with input validation and error handling in Flask routes.
